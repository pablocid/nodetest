## Questions

● What is the difference between JWT and OAuth authentication?

JWT is an access token format and OAuth is an authorization protocol that can include JWT in the implementation. A big difference between both is when some of these are implemented in an application, with OAuth you can close the session effectively while with JWT you will have to wait until the token expires.

● Explain how asymmetric encryption works.

Asymmetric encryption uses two different and related keys. A public key used for encryption and a private key used for decryption. The idea is to send encrypted messages using the public key that can only be decrypted by the recipient who has the private key.

● What are the main differences between a GraphQL and REST API?

A Representational state transfer (REST) API is an architectural concept (or set of protocols) for network-based software and  GraphQL is a query language, a specification, and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP.
